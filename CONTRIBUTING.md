## Development Environment Setup

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alexanderpresto/email-parser.git
cd email-parser

# Option 1: Create development environment with Anaconda
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate email-parser-dev

# Option 2: Create development environment with pip
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install for development
pip install -e ".[dev,test,docs]"
```

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run the full test suite
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=email_parser

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_mime_parsing.py
```

### Code Quality

All code must:

- Be formatted with Black (line length 100)
- Have imports sorted with isort
- Pass mypy static type checking
- Pass security checks with Bandit
- Have appropriate docstrings in the Google format

Automated tools:

```bash
# Format code
black email_parser tests

# Sort imports
isort email_parser tests

# Run type checking
mypy email_parser

# Run security checks
bandit -r email_parser
```

### Documentation

- All public API functions must have Google-style docstrings
- New features must be documented in the appropriate guides
- Update examples for significant API changes

Build documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

## Release Process

1. Update the changelog with all significant changes
2. Update version numbers in:
   - `pyproject.toml`
   - `email_parser/__init__.py`
   - Documentation
3. Create a new GitHub release with a tag matching the version
4. CI/CD will automatically publish to PyPI

## Style Guide

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 with Black formatting (100 character line length)
- Use [Google style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Use type annotations for all functions
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Follow the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - ‚ú® (sparkles) for new features
  - üêõ (bug) for bug fixes
  - üìù (memo) for documentation updates
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è (recycle) for refactoring
  - üß™ (test tube) for adding tests
  - üîß (wrench) for configuration changes

### Branch Naming

- `feature/short-description` for new features
- `bugfix/issue-number-short-description` for bug fixes
- `docs/short-description` for documentation changes
- `refactor/short-description` for code refactoring
