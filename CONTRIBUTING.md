## Development Environment Setup

### üìã Platform-Specific Setup Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: Choose the correct setup based on your development environment:

#### üêß **Claude Code (WSL2/Linux)**
If you're using Claude Code and running IN WSL2/Ubuntu environment:
- **See**: [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for complete setup and workflow instructions
- Uses native Linux commands directly (no WSL prefix)

#### ü™ü **Claude Desktop (Windows)**  
If you're using Claude Desktop on Windows 11 accessing WSL2:
- **See**: [CLAUDE-DESKTOP.md](CLAUDE-DESKTOP.md) for complete setup and workflow instructions  
- All commands use `wsl -d Ubuntu-24.04` prefix

#### Universal Setup Steps

```bash
# Fork and clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/alexanderpresto/email-parser.git
cd email-parser

# Create virtual environment (MANDATORY)
python -m venv email-parser-env

# Activate virtual environment (format varies by platform)
# See platform-specific instruction files for exact syntax

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install for development  
pip install -e .

# Optional: Set up Gemini CLI for enhanced analysis (Claude Code only)
pip install gemini-cli
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"
```

**Note**: Command format varies by platform. See platform-specific instruction files for exact syntax.

#### Gemini CLI Integration (Optional)

For contributions involving large file analysis or advanced processing:

**Platform Support:**
- ‚úÖ **Claude Code (WSL2/Linux)**: Full Gemini CLI support
- ‚ùå **Claude Desktop (Windows)**: Not available due to terminal compatibility

**Setup for Contributors (Claude Code only):**
```bash
# Install Gemini CLI
pip install gemini-cli

# Set up API key
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"

# Verify installation
gemini --version
```

**Integration Guidelines:**
- Use Gemini CLI for processing files >100KB
- Document any Gemini-dependent features clearly
- Ensure fallback behavior when Gemini CLI is unavailable
- Test contributions in both environments (with/without Gemini CLI)

## Development Workflow

### Running Tests

**Commands shown in WSL2/Linux format. For Windows, see [CLAUDE-DESKTOP.md](CLAUDE-DESKTOP.md).**

```bash
# Run the full test suite
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=email_parser

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/test_mime_parsing.py
```

### Code Quality

All code must:

- Be formatted with Black (line length 100)
- Have imports sorted with isort
- Pass mypy static type checking
- Pass security checks with Bandit
- Have appropriate docstrings in the Google format

Automated tools (WSL2/Linux format):

```bash
# Format code
black email_parser tests

# Sort imports
isort email_parser tests

# Run type checking
mypy email_parser

# Run security checks
bandit -r email_parser
```

### Documentation

- All public API functions must have Google-style docstrings
- New features must be documented in the appropriate guides
- Update examples for significant API changes
- Update the [project journal](docs/project_journal.md) with significant changes, decisions, and milestones

Build documentation locally:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```

## Release Process

1. Update the changelog with all significant changes
2. Update version numbers in:
   - `pyproject.toml`
   - `email_parser/__init__.py`
   - Documentation
3. Create a new GitHub release with a tag matching the version
4. CI/CD will automatically publish to PyPI

## Style Guide

### Python Code Style

- Follow PEP 8 with Black formatting (100 character line length)
- Use [Google style docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#38-comments-and-docstrings)
- Use type annotations for all functions
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Follow the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)

### Commit Messages

- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests after the first line

### Acknowledging Inspirations

When contributing features that are inspired by or based on other open-source projects:

- Always give credit in the code comments, documentation, or CREDITS.md
- Include links to the original project
- Respect the licenses of any projects you reference
- If you adapt code or ideas, clearly state what was adapted and how
- Update CREDITS.md with any new inspirations or dependencies

Example:
```python
# PDF conversion approach inspired by obsidian-marker project
# https://github.com/l3-n0x/obsidian-marker
```
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
  - ‚ú® (sparkles) for new features
  - üêõ (bug) for bug fixes
  - üìù (memo) for documentation updates
  - ‚ôªÔ∏è (recycle) for refactoring
  - üß™ (test tube) for adding tests
  - üîß (wrench) for configuration changes

### Branch Naming

- `feature/short-description` for new features
- `bugfix/issue-number-short-description` for bug fixes
- `docs/short-description` for documentation changes
- `refactor/short-description` for code refactoring
