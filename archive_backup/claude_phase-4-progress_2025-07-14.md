## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Converter Integration Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Start with simple adapter pattern
   - Fallback: Minimal viable integration first

2. **Performance Impact**
   - Mitigation: Profile early and often
   - Fallback: Optimize critical paths only

3. **API Design Complexity**
   - Mitigation: Iterative design with user feedback
   - Fallback: Simple API first, extend later

### Project Risks
1. **Timeline Pressure**
   - Mitigation: Prioritize core functionality
   - Fallback: Defer advanced features to future phases

2. **User Confusion**
   - Mitigation: Clear documentation and examples
   - Fallback: Enhanced help system and guides
