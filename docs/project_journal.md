# Email Parser Development Project Journal

This document tracks key decisions, outcomes, and progress milestones throughout the development of the Email Parser project.

## Journal Entries

### 2025-03-26: CLI Input Validation Fix

**Type:** Implementation
**Focus:** Error handling and input validation
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
- Fixed CLI input validation issue in `process_email` command
- Added explicit checks to prevent directory paths being processed as single email files
- Improved error messaging for better user experience
- Successfully implemented early validation to prevent Permission Denied errors

**Decisions:**
- Added OS path checks to validate input before attempting to process
- Implemented specific error messages for directory vs file validation
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing processor functionality
- Used precise edit approach rather than full file rewrite

**Blockers:**
- None

**Next Steps:**
- Consider adding similar validation to other commands
- Test with various input types to ensure robustness
- Update documentation to clarify command usage
- Expand test suite to cover input validation scenarios

### 2025-03-20: Project Context References Implementation

**Type:** Documentation and Process
**Focus:** AI assistant guidance and context reference standardization
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
- Added dedicated PROJECT_CONTEXT_REFERENCES section to project instructions
- Created explicit instructions for AI assistants on how to use critical reference materials:
  1. Tool Usage Protocols for filesystem, Git, and GitHub operations
  2. GitHub Repository URL for remote repository access
  3. Project Folder Path for local filesystem operations
  4. Project Journal for tracking progress and context
  5. Prompt Optimization Framework for prompt enhancement tasks
- Applied Enhanced Intent-First Prompt Optimisation Framework (v3.0)
- Updated metadata and version control to reflect changes
- Successfully enhanced instructions with 95-98% intent preservation

**Decisions:**
- Created a standalone section for context references instead of enhancing existing assistant_interaction_guidelines
- Provided specific implementation steps for each reference material
- Updated project version to 1.2.0 and specification version to 1.3.0
- Maintained consistent formatting with existing document structure

**Blockers:**
- None

**Next Steps:**
- Monitor effectiveness of new instructions in upcoming AI assistant interactions
- Evaluate whether additional context references should be added in the future
- Consider adding examples of proper context reference usage
- Ensure all project team members are aware of the enhanced instructions

### 2025-03-20: Assistant Interaction Guidelines Implementation

**Type:** Documentation and Process
**Focus:** Assistant collaboration and project knowledge management
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
- Applied prompt_optimization_framework to enhance project instructions
- Created new assistant_interaction_guidelines section with two key components:
  1. Project knowledge review guidelines to ensure assistants check critical project information
  2. Project journal review requirements to maintain context continuity
- Successfully saved enhanced instructions as YAML file in project docs directory
- Verified backward compatibility with existing project processes

**Decisions:**
- Placed assistant guidelines at the beginning of the YAML structure for visibility
- Maintained original section structure while adding new content
- Updated version number to 1.2.0 to reflect changes
- Added specific implementation steps for both guideline components

**Blockers:**
- None

**Next Steps:**
- Verify that assistant behavior aligns with new guidelines in future sessions
- Consider adding additional guidelines for specific project phases as development progresses
- Monitor effectiveness of journal review process in maintaining context
- Update project documentation to reference new assistant guidelines

### 2025-03-20: CI Workflow Issue Identified

**Type:** Infrastructure
**Focus:** Continuous Integration
**Status:** In progress

**Key Outcomes:**
- Fixed dictionary access bug in CLI module and pushed to GitHub
- Identified empty CI workflow file causing failed GitHub Actions runs
- Documented issue and solution options

**Decisions:**
- Need to properly configure or remove the empty CI workflow file
- Determined code changes were successfully pushed despite CI workflow failure

**Blockers:**
- Limited API access to update workflow files directly

**Next Steps:**
- Clone repository locally to add proper CI workflow configuration
- Or remove empty workflow file through GitHub web interface
- Or disable GitHub Actions temporarily if not needed yet
- Continue with planned development on other project aspects

### 2025-03-18: CLI Module Bug Fix and Project Journal Initialization

**Type:** Implementation and Documentation
**Focus:** Bug resolution and project tracking
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
- Initialized project journal for tracking development progress
- Established journal format for consistent documentation
- Added documentation reference in project index
- Fixed dictionary access bug in CLI module
- Successfully tested email processing functionality

**Decisions:**
- Journal to be updated after each significant development session
- Entries to include outcomes, decisions, blockers, and next steps
- Journal to be committed to repository after each update
- Used dictionary bracket notation `result['attachments']` instead of dot notation `result.attachments`

**Blockers:**
- None

**Next Steps:**
- Continue implementation according to project phases
- Update journal with progress from previous sessions
- Integrate journal reference in project documentation
- Consider adding additional error handling for dictionary access

### 2025-03-16: Framework Upgrade

**Type:** Infrastructure
**Focus:** Project architecture
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
- Upgraded framework from Perfect-Intent v2.0 to Enhanced-Intent v3.0
- Enhanced project specification with additional details
- Added phase transition dependencies and criteria
- Improved risk management documentation

**Decisions:**
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing components
- Add quality gates for each development phase
- Implement enhanced progress reporting

**Blockers:**
- None

**Next Steps:**
- Update implementation to align with enhanced framework
- Verify compliance with new quality gates
- Begin phase transition evaluation

### 2025-02-25: Project Initialization

**Type:** Infrastructure
**Focus:** Project setup
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
