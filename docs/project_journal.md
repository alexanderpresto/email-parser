This document tracks key decisions, outcomes, and progress milestones throughout the development of the Email Parser project.

## Journal Entries

### 2025-03-20: Assistant Interaction Guidelines Implementation

**Type:** Documentation and Process
**Focus:** Assistant collaboration and project knowledge management
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
- Applied prompt_optimization_framework to enhance project instructions
- Created new assistant_interaction_guidelines section with two key components:
  1. Project knowledge review guidelines to ensure assistants check critical project information
  2. Project journal review requirements to maintain context continuity
- Successfully saved enhanced instructions as YAML file in project docs directory
- Verified backward compatibility with existing project processes

**Decisions:**
- Placed assistant guidelines at the beginning of the YAML structure for visibility
- Maintained original section structure while adding new content
- Updated version number to 1.2.0 to reflect changes
- Added specific implementation steps for both guideline components

**Blockers:**
- None

**Next Steps:**
- Verify that assistant behavior aligns with new guidelines in future sessions
- Consider adding additional guidelines for specific project phases as development progresses
- Monitor effectiveness of journal review process in maintaining context
- Update project documentation to reference new assistant guidelines

### 2025-03-20: CI Workflow Issue Identified

**Type:** Infrastructure
**Focus:** Continuous Integration
**Status:** In progress

**Key Outcomes:**
- Fixed dictionary access bug in CLI module and pushed to GitHub
- Identified empty CI workflow file causing failed GitHub Actions runs
- Documented issue and solution options

**Decisions:**
- Need to properly configure or remove the empty CI workflow file
- Determined code changes were successfully pushed despite CI workflow failure

**Blockers:**
- Limited API access to update workflow files directly

**Next Steps:**
- Clone repository locally to add proper CI workflow configuration
- Or remove empty workflow file through GitHub web interface
- Or disable GitHub Actions temporarily if not needed yet
- Continue with planned development on other project aspects

### 2025-03-18: CLI Module Bug Fix and Project Journal Initialization

**Type:** Implementation and Documentation
**Focus:** Bug resolution and project tracking
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
- Initialized project journal for tracking development progress
- Established journal format for consistent documentation
- Added documentation reference in project index
- Fixed dictionary access bug in CLI module
- Successfully tested email processing functionality

**Decisions:**
- Journal to be updated after each significant development session
- Entries to include outcomes, decisions, blockers, and next steps
- Journal to be committed to repository after each update
- Used dictionary bracket notation `result['attachments']` instead of dot notation `result.attachments`

**Blockers:**
- None

**Next Steps:**
- Continue implementation according to project phases
- Update journal with progress from previous sessions
- Integrate journal reference in project documentation
- Consider adding additional error handling for dictionary access

### 2025-03-16: Framework Upgrade

**Type:** Infrastructure
**Focus:** Project architecture
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
- Upgraded framework from Perfect-Intent v2.0 to Enhanced-Intent v3.0
- Enhanced project specification with additional details
- Added phase transition dependencies and criteria
- Improved risk management documentation

**Decisions:**
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing components
- Add quality gates for each development phase
- Implement enhanced progress reporting

**Blockers:**
- None

**Next Steps:**
- Update implementation to align with enhanced framework
- Verify compliance with new quality gates
- Begin phase transition evaluation

### 2025-02-25: Project Initialization

**Type:** Infrastructure
**Focus:** Project setup
**Status:** Completed

**Key Outcomes:**
- Created initial project structure
- Established development environment
- Defined technical requirements and specifications
- Set up GitHub repository

**Decisions:**
- Implement Python 3.12.9 as target environment
- Use Anaconda for package management
- Follow TDD approach for development

**Blockers:**
- None

**Next Steps:**
- Begin implementation of Phase 1: Foundation
- Set up testing framework
- Create basic MIME parsing functionality
