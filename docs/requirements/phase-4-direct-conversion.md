# Phase 4: Direct File Conversion Requirements

## Overview
Enable standalone document conversion without email context, transforming the email parser into a general-purpose document processor while maintaining backward compatibility.

## Functional Requirements

### FR-4.1: Direct Conversion Interface
- Users can convert individual files without email wrapper
- Support for PDF, DOCX, and Excel formats
- File type auto-detection based on extension
- Validation of file compatibility before processing

### FR-4.2: Batch Conversion
- Process multiple files in a single operation
- Filter by file type in directory scanning
- Progress tracking for batch operations
- Error recovery for failed conversions

### FR-4.3: Profile Integration
- Apply existing processing profiles to direct conversions
- Quick convert mode for minimal configuration
- Advanced mode for full customization
- Profile recommendations based on file type

### FR-4.4: Unified API
- Consistent interface for all document processing
- Standardized input/output patterns
- Extensible for future format support
- Programmatic access for automation

## Non-Functional Requirements

### NFR-4.1: Performance
- Single file overhead < 5 seconds
- Batch efficiency > 80% vs sequential
- Memory usage stable for large batches
- Concurrent processing where applicable

### NFR-4.2: Usability
- Intuitive menu navigation
- Clear progress indicators
- Helpful error messages
- Consistent with email processing UX

### NFR-4.3: Compatibility
- Maintain backward compatibility
- No breaking changes to email processing
- Same configuration format
- Existing profiles work unchanged

## Technical Requirements

### TR-4.1: Architecture
- Leverage existing converter infrastructure
- Minimal coupling to email components
- Factory pattern for converter selection
- Clean separation of concerns

### TR-4.2: Error Handling
- Graceful handling of unsupported formats
- Clear messaging for missing dependencies
- API failure recovery (PDF/MistralAI)
- Corrupt file detection

### TR-4.3: Testing
- Unit tests for new components
- Integration tests for converters
- End-to-end conversion tests
- Performance benchmarks

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Functionality**
   - [ ] All three formats convert successfully standalone
   - [ ] Batch processing works for mixed file types
   - [ ] Progress tracking accurate for all operations
   - [ ] Error messages helpful and actionable

2. **Performance**
   - [ ] Meets overhead requirements
   - [ ] Memory usage acceptable
   - [ ] Batch processing efficient
   - [ ] No regression in email processing

3. **Quality**
   - [ ] Test coverage > 80% for new code
   - [ ] Documentation complete
   - [ ] No critical bugs
   - [ ] Code review approved

## Dependencies
- Existing converter classes (PDFConverter, DocxConverter, ExcelConverter)
- ProcessingConfig system
- Progress tracking utilities
- Interactive CLI framework

## Risks
1. **API Complexity**: Mitigate with iterative design
2. **Performance Impact**: Profile and optimize
3. **User Confusion**: Clear documentation and UX

## Timeline
- Week 1: Core implementation and testing
- Week 2: API design and polish
- Total: 2 weeks starting 2025-07-08
