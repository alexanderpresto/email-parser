# Claude Code Hooks Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed
The Claude Code hooks were not triggering because the configuration was placed in the wrong location.

## Problem Identified
- **Incorrect Location**: `claude-hooks-config.json` (separate file)
- **Correct Location**: `.claude/settings.json` (official Claude Code settings file)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Configuration Location Fix
- **MOVED** hooks configuration from `claude-hooks-config.json` to `.claude/settings.json`
- **VERIFIED** proper JSON structure follows official Claude Code documentation
- **ENSURED** `.claude/` directory is properly gitignored

### 2. Updated Template Documents
Updated both implementation templates with corrections:

#### Files Updated:
- `D:\Users\alexp\dev\templates\basic-memory-claude-hooks-implementation-prompt.md`
- `D:\Users\alexp\dev\templates\basic-memory-claude-hooks-technical-guide.md`

#### Key Changes Made:
1. **Configuration Location**: Changed from `claude-hooks-config.json` to `.claude/settings.json`
2. **Added Warnings**: Clear warnings about incorrect configuration placement
3. **Updated Installation**: Fixed setup instructions to use correct location
4. **Enhanced Troubleshooting**: Added specific guidance about configuration file location
5. **Added Corrections Section**: Explicit ❌/✅ comparison of wrong vs. right approaches

### 3. Current Working Configuration

**Location**: `.claude/settings.json`

  }
}

## Why This Fix Was Necessary

### Official Claude Code Documentation
According to https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/hooks:
- Hooks configuration must be in `.claude/settings.json`
- Configuration files include:
  - `~/.claude/settings.json` (user-level)
  - `.claude/settings.json` (project-level)  
  - `.claude/settings.local.json` (local project)
- Custom hook files like `claude-hooks-config.json` are NOT supported

### Project Structure Requirements
- `.claude/` directory should be in `.gitignore`
- Configuration is local-only (not committed to repository)
- Scripts remain in `scripts/` directory as before

## Testing Status
- ✅ Configuration syntax validated
- ✅ File location confirmed correct
- ✅ Scripts exist and are accessible
- ✅ Hooks should now trigger on Edit/Write/MultiEdit operations

## Template Updates Applied
Both templates now include:
1. **Correct configuration location** instructions
2. **Explicit warnings** about common mistakes
3. **Updated installation procedures**
4. **Enhanced troubleshooting guidance**
5. **Before/after comparison** for clarity

The hooks system should now function properly according to official Claude Code specifications.
